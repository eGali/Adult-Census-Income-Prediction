Dataset used is from kaggle.

The goal of this data science project was to learn from all the features given such as age, education, marital status, etc... to try and predict 
if the individual made over 50k.

Project was done on a Jupyter notebook in python. We used various libraries including pandas, numpy, matplot lib, and a few others as well 
as many machine learning algorithms.
For more in depth information, including some nice graphs, and results take a look at the presentation pdf.
